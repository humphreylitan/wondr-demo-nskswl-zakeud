Some other practical tips are, you know, when you laser, typically you're going to move the fiber very slowly, a millimeter per second,

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.640
it's typically the way in which we do the case because that allows you to achieve large lumens and helps to facilitate the inflation that happens with laser.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.199
Additional to that, we typically will choose a fiber size relative to the size of the artery.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.760
Most of us will use the point line laser probably 80% of the time. The one time when we use a 1.4 is when there's a substantial amount of calcium

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:33.600
and multi-layer eyes are, we make it a little bit more energy delivered to what is a pretty difficult lesion subset to treat.

Let me make sounds, thank you.
