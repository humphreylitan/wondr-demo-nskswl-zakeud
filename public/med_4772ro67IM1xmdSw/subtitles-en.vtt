00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.299
Thank you Dr. Croes for taking the time today to sit down with Phillips and I to chat about laser

2
00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.800
authorectomy. Can you tell me a little bit about your practice?

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.599
Yeah, I'm a corner in an eventual finishing in Boston, Massachusetts. I've been on staff at the

4
00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.640
Brigham Women's Hospital for about 15 years. Did my fellowship here? I've been joked with my wife

5
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.640
and me dying this job, but it'd been her long time. We run a pretty busy CTL complex PCI program.

6
00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:30.399
A couple wonderful partners in a team of people that treat complex corner disease.

7
00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.119
Excited to be here. Thanks for the invitation. Thank you.

8
00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:36.079
Can you explain the advantages of laser authorectomy?

9
00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.960
Yeah, so you know, we got laser initially as a CTO tool, but that I think really

10
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.759
readily able to understand the value of it in complex PCI in general.

11
00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:51.439
So you know, the device from a supporting chip cases or complex PCI cases has a lot of value.

12
00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:55.200
Some of the unique features of it are tunable. You can change the rate in the

13
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.960
fluency or the power of it. It can be, you can liaison on any wires. You're not married to an

14
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.319
authorectomy wire like you are with rotational authorectomy or overlapped rectomy. It's cool because

15
00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:11.920
in bifurcation you can keep two wires down. A laser into one laser into another, which is difficult

16
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.680
to do with mechanical authorectomy devices. And you need to think about, there's minimal risk of

17
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.519
entrapment. You're hard to get a laser stuck like you might have wrote a bird. And so for that

18
00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:25.599
reason we have applied it to many different types as we'll talk about, but I think you know,

19
00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:29.760
it's grown to be an important part of our toolkit and complex PCI treatment.

20
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.959
Right. Can you describe the mechanism of action?

21
00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:38.079
Yeah, so laser-highest three main mechanisms of action. The first is, you know, an ablative

22
00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.719
capacity. Effectively it can vaporize tissue, changes, you know, material into atoms.

23
00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.879
Additionally, one of the most important features especially for instant restnosis,

24
00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:52.319
the second main mechanism of action is laser. It's kind of like light-paced lithotripsy.

25
00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.359
When you laser in an arterial system, you get an acoustic mechanical energy wave.

26
00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:02.079
The creasy shockwave is able to change the compliance and soften tissue, such as calcium.

27
00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.719
And then the cavitation bubble is able to help a bleed and sort of, you know, soften

28
00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.879
mixed morphology tissue. For us, really, we focus on the ablative capacity

29
00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.560
and the acoustic mechanical mechanism as a ones which are really kind of focusing and using

30
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.319
a lot in cases that we treat patients.

31
00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.599
Great. Can you talk a little bit about the laser workflow?

32
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.280
Yeah, so the workflow is, you know, for us, a complex PCI cases, you know, always follows the same,

33
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.840
you know, cadence. You know, good guide support. Make sure you, you know, go, you know,

34
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.319
into a gunfight, aren't with just a knife. So, getting supportive guides, understanding the

35
00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.159
difficulty potentially the case ahead of time. That includes where we're accessing from,

36
00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.759
what type of sheath, what type of guide, what shape a guide. And, you know, once we get a wire

37
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.360
across the region, we're really focused on using a traversal imaging to help guide our case planning.

38
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.280
And so, you know, utilization of laser in our practice, we use a lot of times for instant

39
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.919
recinosis for CTO work. And so, in an ISR case, you know, if a strength is failed, we're going

40
00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:05.199
to try to determine what the best way to treat it is is wire down imaging catheter, often,

41
00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:10.000
Ivys Cross or OCT across, understand what's happening. And then in a scenario where there's

42
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.159
indication for laser either, stensor, underexpand, or we want to oblate tissue,

43
00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.280
well, then balloon a little bit to make some space. Laser with an appropriately size laser,

44
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.240
which is chosen based on the intravascular imaging. And go ahead and have the desired effect on

45
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.199
the lesion be, you know, change the compliance to help expand things. I help us to get through

46
00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:34.000
difficult anatomy, which is hard to cross. And then balloon and stent in restent of we're going

47
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.120
to. And so, there really is kind of a very quick cadence of wire intravascular image to

48
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.039
decide what you need to do, apply the laser based on the mechanism that you're trying to harness

49
00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:48.719
in terms of changing a plan for a blade tissue. And then stent, or balloon, or balloon and stent,

50
00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:52.560
and then image on the back end to make sure we've got the desired effect to check our work.

51
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.360
Great, that actually led me to my next question. Can you just briefly discuss the laser

52
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.919
indications? And also, it's use in your practice. Yeah, so laser has a lot of indications,

53
00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.319
which is both a good thing. It fits really broadly into our toolbox. It also can be confusing

54
00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.960
for physicians. You know, you can use it in vingress. You can use it in instant restinosis. You can

55
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.399
use it to oblate throments. You can use it in CTO cases. We have a wire cross. And so, a little bit

56
00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:21.279
of the sweet spot for our practice of where we use laser at the back end means kind of tied to the

57
00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:26.639
const cases. If you're doing it, we're not a high-volume STEMI center. I do more CTOs than I personally

58
00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.480
do STEMI isn't giving you. So if you sort of ask me where I'm using laser, it's in the kind of cases

59
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.279
that are the wheelhouse of what I'm doing every day. If you contrast that to say age, where they have,

60
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.040
a lot of laser use at ACS cases, they're often used to oblate throments. It's sort of deal with,

61
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.040
you know, deep-olking thromotic material. And our practice laser really has been adopted quite

62
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.639
readily by myself, my partner, in two places, in instant restinosis and in CTOs. And we use it in

63
00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.199
these cases really as a function of, you know, trying to use the atherectomy device to either help

64
00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.000
facilitate legional expansion or help cross legions, which are difficult to deal with. There is,

65
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.680
you know, a broad experience of laser and vein grass to be able to deep-olk,

66
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.160
lipidic material, the less the chances in the reflow, to reduce the thrombotic burden in ACS.

67
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.920
But for us, you're really focused on where we treat patients, which is an instant

68
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.639
restinosis chip in CTO, which is the main type of cases that we do in our program.

69
00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.879
Dr. Croes, can you talk a little bit about your use of laser atherectomy in CTOs?

70
00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.680
Yes, we actually acquired laser as a CTO tool. That's the reason we got it into our

71
00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.639
complex PCI tool box. And I think, you know, the value there is when we have a CTO

72
00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.600
lesion, which is difficult across laser can be transformed in terms of the experience you

73
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.480
allow you to get gear through, you know, softening proximal caps when you have a wire into

74
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.000
lesion or cross lesion. Really is, it's a main utility in our CTO practice. It's really

75
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.759
employed often as part of what we would call a wire across and gear won't go algorithm.

76
00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.680
When you have a lesion, you can't get balloons or microcatheters through lesers really,

77
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.240
really helpful. You know, with our new leser, it warms up really quickly. But back in the old

78
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.360
day, we're like, all right, I've tried a microcatheter too. I'm not getting balloons across.

79
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.399
Let's get the leser and it's start to warm it up for five minutes because, you know,

80
00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:14.800
then I'm ready to actually use it in time. And so the leser is helpful because when you

81
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.040
have a wire through lesion, it's often at calcium or dense fibroidic plaque problem.

82
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.360
And if you can't get balloons or catheters through it, you can't start to treat it.

83
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.680
And so by bringing a leser up to the plaque and actually actually, actually,

84
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.360
adding up it on the plaque, you're able to change the compliance. We're oftentimes

85
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.680
the leser itself will traverse through. But even if it doesn't, even if the leser doesn't

86
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.399
cross, a lot of times that acoustic mechanical energy, that mechanism of action to change

87
00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:46.639
compliance allows you then to able to come in with a microcatheter, come in with a balloon,

88
00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:50.800
and get that through and start to make some head-wank and across lesion. If you can't cross

89
00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.879
the block, it's you can't treat it. And so, you know, the algorithm for that that will

90
00:06:54.879 --> 00:07:00.000
discuss in the case that we have is really to improve backup, use a microcatheter, and leser

91
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.240
used to be pretty far down my list because it's so effective in our experience. I've actually bumped

92
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.600
up to the time when I'm starting to struggle, struggle, we're getting the leser set up,

93
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.720
we're ready to use it. And we'll actually, it's transformed, we have it in terms of

94
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.000
lines to cross lesions, which were previously difficult to get through.

95
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.879
Great. Do you maybe have a case example?

96
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.680
Yeah, so I have a case example of how we use leser in a CTO application.

97
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.360
And so this is a patient that was referred to us for treatment of a left-circum flex CTO. You can see

98
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.319
here that he had a long-standing RCA CTO for which he was actually asymptomatic. And when

99
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.839
he closed his circumflex, he was having terrible clash through engine. And so this looked us like

100
00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:42.079
a pretty straightforward treatment. We had a seven-french radial system, which, you know, we figured

101
00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:46.079
to give reasonable backup. And we went ahead and sort of took, you know, standard approach,

102
00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:52.319
pilot 200 CTO wire, cross, pretty readily as you see here. And with the left-left collaterals,

103
00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:56.720
we confirmed that we're in the lumen of the vessel. And we figured this would be relatively straightforward.

104
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.680
And I think surprisingly, our microcatheter would not cross. We tried to initially get across

105
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.040
with a turnpike LP microcatheter. You can see that as I'm pushing the catheter, I sort of, I

106
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:13.040
thought I stored the flur here. The guide is kicking out. The guide liner is kicking out. Really

107
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.600
nothing wants to get through it. And so in this particular example, we started to employ various

108
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:23.040
features of our wire across. And nothing will go algorithm. We changed our microcatheter. We changed

109
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.720
to a turnpike spiral catheter, which has screw threads on. And we were able to often screw that

110
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.080
through. And similarly, we're unable to get across. And so in this next maneuver, we just took a very

111
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.360
small balloon, a 1.5 millimeter balloon. And still, we tried to wedge it into the plaque to see if

112
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.440
you could make a little bit space. And still, I couldn't get anything to go through it. And so,

113
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.840
at this point, we're getting the laser in the room and getting it warmed up. There's a really,

114
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.919
I think, well, tread and sort of well, describe why a cross gear won't go algorithm for what you

115
00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:56.320
do in these types of scenarios. The first thing is you can increase backup. We already had a guide

116
00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.000
extended, we already had a seven-french guide. You can use things like anchor balloons and other

117
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.720
maneuvers that I want to review today. Try to add a microcatheter. I actually had tried to already

118
00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:10.399
try small balloons with progressive inflation. I tried that. There's a CTO maneuver called grenade

119
00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:14.720
a plastic. We actually purposely explored the balloon to try and change the compliance of the

120
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.120
lesion that way. We didn't try that in this particular example, but you can see readily in this list of

121
00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.000
things as laser-athorectomy. And so, with this in mind, before we went to sort of all sorts of very

122
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.480
aggressive things that I want to review, like sub-enimal plaque modification. And other things you can

123
00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:33.279
do to extend guide liners and pin them against the wall to get better support. We readily went

124
00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:38.480
with a laser in this. And so, even after that little balloon inflation, we tried another microcatheter,

125
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:44.799
it still wouldn't cross. You can see here there's a 0.9 laser on 60 fluids and 60 rate

126
00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:50.799
and very readily in real time in this floro store traverses through the lesion quite effectively.

127
00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:56.320
And so, it's a nice example, I thought to show of how laser can be used to facilitate CTO,

128
00:09:56.399 --> 00:10:02.080
PCI. After the laser cross, we actually had a TMI 3 flow and actually made a nice little channel.

129
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.639
And we did Ivys' guided stent in this example and got a nice final result here. And so,

130
00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:10.000
I had this case example for our conversation today because I think it really shows

131
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.679
quite quickly the utility of laser-aths, part of an algorithm to deal with a known CTO problem,

132
00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:18.480
which is when you get a wire cross, sometimes you can't get stuff to follow it.

133
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.080
Thank you so much Dr. Croce, I was an excellent case example. Along those lines,

134
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.759
can you talk about use of laser-athorectomy and treating instant restinosis?

135
00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:30.399
Yeah, so as we talked about earlier, and we got laser as a CTO tool originally.

136
00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:35.679
But we have a pretty busy referral practice for instant restinosis. We're one of the centers in

137
00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:40.639
New England, which does break your therapy for multi-layer instant restinosis. And so, we see lots of

138
00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:45.759
patients with failed stents and although we hit acquired laser as a CTO tool, we readily found

139
00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:51.600
a application for in ISR cases. It has a lot of value there. I think the ability to oblate

140
00:10:51.679 --> 00:10:58.240
tissue and soften make more compliant, calcific tissues, really one of the values of laser.

141
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.080
The acoustic mechanical energy, which is the mechanism of action we talked about, is really,

142
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.440
really helpful in terms of for under-expandage stents, which are surrounded and arrived at calcium.

143
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.320
It allows us to actually at the laser and fracture and change the compliance of that calcium,

144
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.600
so we can get stents to expand better. And so we use laser a lot in ISR cases,

145
00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:23.120
helping to remediate, un-expand, and also to try and core out or oblate some of the new

146
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.559
animal tissue, which is leading to the stenosis that's creating chest pain and the reasons

147
00:11:26.559 --> 00:11:31.039
why patients refer to us. Great. Do you happen to have a case example? Yeah, so I have, you know,

148
00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:34.960
ironically, a CTO case, which is an instant case, we can go over it, sort of touches on

149
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.519
a both features of what we're here to talk about today. This is sort of a complicated presentation.

150
00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:45.759
It's a 68-year-old gentleman who actually had two prior sternonemies. He had a bypass surgery in 2007,

151
00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:50.960
and then a reduced sternonomy, you know, over 10 years later, to get an aortic valve replacement.

152
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.600
Normally, he had mild chronic reliance efficiency, and he was referred to us from the ER with

153
00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.039
six out of 10 chest pain. He was actually a blowing snow using a snowblower in his driveway during one of

154
00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:06.000
our Boston winters. His slight inferior lateral esthalivations had had a little bit of improvement in

155
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.039
a symptom to the VKG after getting some happenet nitro. So he came in and we did our diagnostic

156
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.120
and geography. You can see here that, you know, his left man doesn't supply too too much.

157
00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:21.919
His circumflex is a CTO, which is an instant CTO. There's multiple views here in the RAO,

158
00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:28.159
AP coddle, and LAO coddle. His Lima not surprisingly was patent as they often are. He can see it's a

159
00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:34.240
good vessel going to get LED. And the culprit really was this, this vangraph, which actually

160
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:40.240
supplied blood to the circumflex system. And this vangraph, it actually been stented already,

161
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.960
and he had multiple layers of stented in the vangraph. You can see that here, and the vangraph

162
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.480
had a severe enastemotic legion, which was compromising flow. And so really we had a conversation,

163
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.120
you know, about what the best thing to do is, do we deal with treating the degenerated,

164
00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.159
already stented vangraph with multiple layers of stented and laminated thrombus? You know,

165
00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:04.879
we talked a little bit of utility of laser in vangraph treatment. It's possible you could take a

166
00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:10.000
laser down and try to oblate some of this thrombotic material to facilitate a vangraph intervention.

167
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.320
But usually after a vangraph has been stented a bunch of times, or particularly in a case like this,

168
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:19.120
where there's some risk of dislumabilization that thrombus. We decided it would be better to treat

169
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.639
the native cTO. And he'd been doing well enough, you know, it really is a matter of that

170
00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:26.879
having this particular slide of which is going to be faster, and then which is going to be more

171
00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:31.600
durable. Rather than dealing with an enastemotic stenosis, already stented vangraph,

172
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:37.440
and all the clot we tended to want to focus on the native cTO PCI. For what was about a 13-year-old

173
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:43.440
left circumplex, left circumplex, instant-reestinosis cTO. So, you know, there's lots of ways you can

174
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:50.240
deal with cTO in stent. We always use dual injection when possible to highlight the target of where

175
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.879
we're going after. And so, in this particular case, we did dual injection angiography. You can

176
00:13:54.879 --> 00:14:00.159
consider using it across boss, which is a way to deal with ISR, cTO, to try and stay in the stents.

177
00:14:00.159 --> 00:14:03.679
This was firm enough in fibrodic enough. I didn't think that was going to be the best option.

178
00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:06.720
And there is a retrograde option to come through the vangraph. If indeed,

179
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.879
we failed with the integrated wire escalation plan that we were considering. So, you can see,

180
00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:15.279
readily here, we actually went out the side of the stent strut, which can often happen in ISR, cTO's

181
00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:19.840
real little bit off target. We redirected and we actually had a marker wire down the graph,

182
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.399
the shows we were going. And eventually, we were able, you know, to get through a resistant

183
00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:28.799
distal cap, revel about a time poking through, but eventually by taking a penetrating wire,

184
00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:34.879
we achieved a lumenal position in the target area through the instent cTO shown here. We

185
00:14:34.879 --> 00:14:38.960
exchanged for a workhorse wire, had a little bit of trouble getting catheter to the cross.

186
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.279
We actually facilitated that wire exchange with the caravel. Unfortunately, the tip broke off

187
00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:47.200
in the legion. We left it there for the case and ended up snaring out at the end. But this sort of

188
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.960
told showed me as we were trying to get micro catheter to the cross and more than actually fractured

189
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.639
during that process. This was going to be a fairly resistant cTO to deal with.

190
00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.000
We left the caravel tip on the wires you can see for here and really tried to dilate the

191
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:07.519
nc balloons which were unexpandable. The I-vis showed calcium in all 360 degrees of the

192
00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:13.440
under expanded stance. This stance were only about 50% diameter expanded and a couple areas

193
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:17.120
had multi layer based on the I-vis. So this really followed the algorithm we talked about, you know,

194
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.799
wire across. I have to see what's, I have to see what's going on and really change your strategy

195
00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:26.720
of what your plaque preparation is going to be based on the I-vis. We have a such a hard time

196
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.039
expanding this saw so much calcium. So I'm in extent to under expansion that readily for us

197
00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:36.240
this becomes a laser atherectomy problem. So you went ahead and took a one-four laser, brought it

198
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.879
through there, did about eight separate runs in this area to try and change the compliance and

199
00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:45.519
readily after that you can see your non-compliant balloons expanded quite well. So with this we were

200
00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:50.799
able to place overlapping drug-leading stance that's shown here reconstructed this segment.

201
00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:55.840
Got a very nice result and geographically had much improved expansion by I-vis. You can see the final

202
00:15:55.919 --> 00:16:00.159
result is here. We actually then took a snare down and removed the tip of the caravel

203
00:16:00.159 --> 00:16:05.279
with our henchier plastic wire and the final result is shown here on the right. And so

204
00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:10.960
able to open the instant ISR, CTO and the setting of an ACS in a patient where we thought

205
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:15.600
the V-en graph would be less readily feasible unless less long-term durable if we treated it.

206
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.039
We're able to get in don't the 120 C-C-C-Za contrast and he went home the next day with baseline

207
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:26.240
renal function. So excellent case example. Thank you so much for showing that. I do have one more

208
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:33.120
question and then I'll have you go if you don't mind. Any new emerging data or science around Liza

209
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.840
Arthur or Therachdemy? Yes, there's been a publication recently in terms of the safety and

210
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:43.919
feasibility of using laser and all types of intervention. Several registries have been published recently

211
00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:48.080
people have come out with a bunch of consensus papers to try and guide our field how to use this

212
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.720
tool. Liza is an older tool. It was probably first approved maybe when you were in high school

213
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.000
or you were in the computer and it's highly nice re-birth as we've re-learned how to use it in our

214
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.400
current armamentarium of treating complex C-AD patients. Our group was lucky enough to participate

215
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.359
in a single center study that we're about to publish. I'm really focusing on the use of laser

216
00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:16.880
Athorectomy and instant re-synosis. So in 304 sequential ISR cases, we're Liza reviews and some

217
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.079
part of Liza reviews is slightly off-label in the study of contrast but you're not experienced

218
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:29.200
able to show excellent safety and excellent efficacy of Liza in terms of remediating about 70

219
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.799
percentage patients. We're multi-layer ISR difficulties span cases and so what we're able to show is

220
00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:40.000
it in a quantitative cornering angiography assessment of multi-layer ISR patients. Treated

221
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.519
Liza are able to get market improvement in their angiographic percent damage denosis with an

222
00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:50.559
excellent safety profile. Liza is a low rates of the section, no perforations attributed to Liza.

223
00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:55.119
Even if you use it off a label a little bit like we did in this and really excellent ability

224
00:17:55.119 --> 00:17:59.440
to facilitate treatment of complex C-AD patients. So we look forward to sharing that with the

225
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.599
community because I really think it speaks to the value of ISR patients that get treated with

226
00:18:03.599 --> 00:18:07.440
Liza in terms of it facilitating workflow which is both efficient and gets expansion of

227
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.680
lesions which are difficult to dilate. Thank you so much Dr. Croce. I was very educational.

228
00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.680
I know that I definitely learned a lot from those questions. Glad to be here today. I

229
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.559
appreciate it. If anybody wants to learn more about Liza or I'll correct me,

230
00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:22.160
there's a pretty robust community of people that are employed in the practice. Reach out

231
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.119
but you know, let me know if I can help in any way. Awesome. Thank you so much.
