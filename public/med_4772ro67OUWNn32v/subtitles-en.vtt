00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
Do you touch a bit of on laser and vangrath interventions?

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.119
It's helpful in that when we think about vangrath interventions, you know there's these big

3
00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.439
bulky plaques that can embalize and you get no reflow and issues like that.

4
00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.920
And so what we've done is take our laser catheter over the wire, go down, do some laser

5
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.760
treatment, and then put your filter wire down or something like that.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.399
When you're taking a really tight 90-95% lesion in a vangrath, it's hard to get your

7
00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:28.399
filter to pass.

8
00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.240
And so if you use your laser catheter, kind of create a channel, oblate some of that plaque,

9
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.079
then you're able to put your filter wire down, do your intervention, and do it much safer.

10
00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.520
So I think it's a very good use of laser.

11
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.520
You know, it's a very safe, subgroup to use laser and as well with a very low risk of complications.

12
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.320
I think it's a good one to really utilize.

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.320
So they're resting.

14
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.840
What about the use of laser-ath direct to me in bifurcations?

15
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.439
So another great question.

16
00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:57.240
As you know, when we do bifurcations and we need to use f-rectomy devices, we can't do

17
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.240
it with two wires down.

18
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.359
You run the risk of cutting the other wire and things.

19
00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.640
And so when we have difficult to cross lesions or we have lesions that are very

20
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.239
calcified out of bifurcation, sometimes it's helpful to use the laser because the laser

21
00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:11.640
is not going to cut that wire, right?

22
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.959
So you can do both limbs of a bifurcation with laser treatments and not risk having to

23
00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:22.799
lose your wire position or damage your wire or something of that nature.

24
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.920
Finally, you know, I know we've been able to get the new laser-ath direct to me console.

25
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.319
But you're going to talk a bit about this and compare this into the old console in terms

26
00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:32.920
of set of the needs of the use.

27
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.920
Yeah, I know.

28
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.719
It's been really amazing the new set up that they have.

29
00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.719
I mean, the old system was probably three times the size is the new one.

30
00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.120
It was very heavy.

31
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.840
It took five minutes to warm up.

32
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.000
So you know, interventional cardiologist is extremely patient people and five minutes

33
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.359
is nothing to us, right?

34
00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:51.359
I mean, it was awful.

35
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.560
You'd sit there and have to wait.

36
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.280
It was terrible.

37
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.439
And so now you can roll it in much easier.

38
00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.280
The console itself doesn't have that warm up time.

39
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.680
So that's much better.

40
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.120
It used to require a special outlet to plug it into which it doesn't anymore.

41
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.560
So now really, you can take your laser catheter wherever you need to go to whatever you

42
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.560
need to do.

43
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.560
It's very easy to do.

44
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.280
It's very easy to set up.

45
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.360
And the whole system itself is great for normalizing it or standardizing it and plugging things

46
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.080
in, it just works fantastic.

47
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.800
It's a huge improvement.

48
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.240
We've noticed our cath lab staff being much more happy, you know, setting that up and

49
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.240
things like that.

50
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.240
And finally, what do you think as a fellow would be advantageous to complete the laser

51
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.240
training course?

52
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.759
Well, you know, a lot of the things we've talked about today, get covered in the laser

53
00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:39.759
course.

54
00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:44.840
It gives you some hands-on experience with the modeling systems.

55
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.000
You really understand your device.

56
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.360
It will go over kind of how it works, the science of it, the different settings of it.

57
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.840
So you get a lot more information than just, you know, kind of what we've talked about today.

58
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.639
You know, ultimately, interventional cardiologies about knowing your gear and your product.

59
00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.639
And if you don't know what you're using inside and out, you don't know how to apply it.

60
00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.599
And you don't know how to get the most out of that stuff.

61
00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.080
And so I think a course will really help hone those skills for laser for any devices that

62
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.360
you use an interventional cardiology.

63
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.960
I think it'd be incredibly important to take sort of that course and get that experience.

64
00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.159
In that extra training.

65
00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.159
Thank you.

66
00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:27.000
Dr. Sintek, I recently came across your publication looking at the safety of laser in circulation.

67
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.560
You kind of touch upon some of the findings of that paper.

68
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.680
Certainly, no, great.

69
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.400
So what we ended up doing was looking at safety with laser use.

70
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.560
And our calf PCI registry here in this country keeps track of all the PCIs.

71
00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.000
And as a part of that, they have a data field that's selected for laser.

72
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.360
And so essentially what we did over about a seven year time period is we pulled all those cases that were coded as laser and looked for safety outcomes.

73
00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.360
And what we found was, is that over about 20,000 laser cases that it was very safe,

74
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.840
the overall complication rate.

75
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.800
So dissection, perforation, cardiac tamponon was about 4.2% if you combine those up.

76
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.520
If you didn't use any after-ectomy devices, it was about 3%.

77
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.480
So it was more, but it wasn't substantially more, you know, from a numbers perspective.

78
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.759
What we found was, is that were certain groupings where it worked very well and was very safe.

79
00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.720
So this would have been the instant-recent analysis group.

80
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.759
It was very safe.

81
00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:31.360
It was almost protective against those complications when you compare it to other cases where laser was used.

82
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.600
Bane graft intervention is another grouping where it was protective when you looked at other laser cases.

83
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.680
So overall, we were very happy with the results and it showed that, you know, this is a great device to use in the cath lab.

84
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.439
It's very safe to use, especially if it's used correctly.

85
00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:53.279
And it really should be something that we put in our, you know, toolbox to treat complicated patients these days.

86
00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:54.319
Very interesting.
