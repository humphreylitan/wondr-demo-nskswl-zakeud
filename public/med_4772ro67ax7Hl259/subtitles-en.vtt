00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.919
Dr. Sintak, thank you for joining me today.

2
00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:10.320
I recently came across your publication, looking at Elka and ISR cases.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.720
Did you talk to me a little bit about the findings of the study?

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.359
So we did. We did a study looking at laser use in the Catholic PCI registry from the

5
00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.320
NCDR, the National Cardiovascular Data Research database.

6
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.199
And so this takes all PCI throughout the United States from most centers and codes them for

7
00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.200
different variables.

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.640
And so what we did is we looked at the codes for use of laser in their and pulled out all

9
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.600
that information and then analyzed it compared to those who didn't have laser, but then

10
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.479
also analyzed it within that group kind of what subgroups was laser working in, what

11
00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.320
subgroups wasn't not working in.

12
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.560
And so we ended up getting about 20,000 cases where laser was coded and used, which is by far

13
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.799
the largest collection of laser cases looking at safety.

14
00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.880
And this is really just a safety analysis.

15
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.519
So we can't really get as to whether or not it was efficacious or more efficacious

16
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.040
in some instances, but it was really looking at safety.

17
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.079
And what we found was that in general, laser was very safe.

18
00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:18.359
The overall complication rate, if you take into consideration, dissection, perforation,

19
00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:22.079
tamponod, major things that we care about that might harm somebody.

20
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.319
It was about 4.3%.

21
00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:29.640
And if you took all the other interventions or PCIs that didn't use F-rectomy devices,

22
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.000
it was about 3%.

23
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.680
So it was more, but it wasn't a ton more and still very safe.

24
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.200
And what we found was that there were certain subgroups that it seemed to perform in

25
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.519
better, or it was more safe in those subgroups.

26
00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:46.879
And so that one would have been vein graphed interventions, which I know, you know, that

27
00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:48.599
we've used these a lot for those sort of things.

28
00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.000
And then also instant recent osures, or what we call ISR.

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.840
And it seemed as though if you looked at laser use in the ISR group, it was actually

30
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.079
protective against having complications.

31
00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.879
If you compare it to laser use in all the other different sort of lesion.

32
00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:07.439
So you pull out the group that just uses laser and ISR.

33
00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.919
And you compare it to all the other lasers that were used for the other groups.

34
00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:17.080
And what you found was there's about a 50% reduction in adverse outcomes with using it in ISR.

35
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.879
And then the other cool thing that we found was that laser use has gone up really significantly

36
00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:23.280
over the last probably seven years.

37
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.680
It's almost a fivefold increase in use of laser over the last five years.

38
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.599
And that group that's grown really the most has been that ISR group.

39
00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.400
So it sort of supports what we think is important and safety.

40
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.800
And it supports using laser in that group.

41
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.000
So now that we've talked about the study in context, why is the mechanism of action of laser

42
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.919
helpful in these cases of ISR?

43
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.360
A lot of the mechanism of the action of the laser is aimed at the mechanism of action of ISR.

44
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.599
And so we think a large portion of ISR is caused by under expanded stance.

45
00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.199
We put a stentin, a cow's wide lesion.

46
00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:05.120
And because we didn't treat that lesion of fronts, the stents is smaller.

47
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.840
The area is smaller.

48
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.400
And so there's a higher propensity to recentose.

49
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.479
This has really been brought out with the drug-loving stent era because once you take out that

50
00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:18.719
new insimal proliferation or that scar that forms inside the stent, with the drug-loving

51
00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.080
stents, it magnifies the effect of having a under expanded stent.

52
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.479
We do see new insimal proliferation and we see new Athoscarosis and stents.

53
00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:31.479
But for the large part, it's under expanded stents.

54
00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:36.120
So what the laser does is it allows you to with this vapor bubble.

55
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.080
And this mechanism of action break up and get rid of that calcium and that stuff behind

56
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.080
the stent.

57
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.479
It also cuts very nicely that new insimal tissue and gets that out of there so you have a

58
00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.039
larger liminal gain.

59
00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:54.879
What you see in some of these small studies that have observed this is, if you look with OCT

60
00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.879
and things like that in study it more, you'll see that what it appears after you laser

61
00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.280
is that it allows for more stent expansion and less dissections and disruptions of those

62
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.280
plaques.

63
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.400
It's a more uniform expansion of that stent.

64
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.400
It has been reported that there are increased complications out of the use of mechanical

65
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.079
Athorectomy and instant re-stenosis.

66
00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.800
Can you kind of touch a bit of on this in particular laser Athorectomy in these cases?

67
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.639
Yeah, certainly.

68
00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.439
And so you may or may not know this, but laser has been around longer than any Athorectomy

69
00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:28.439
device.

70
00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.160
Laser has been around longer than drug-loving stents has been.

71
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.959
And so we've had a large experience with laser.

72
00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:38.319
And what we found in the earlier days, so back in kind of the 90s, we were using laser

73
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.319
differently.

74
00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.839
We weren't using it with a saline flush.

75
00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:47.079
We were using it to, instead of stents, we were using it kind of in lieu of stents.

76
00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:50.319
The idea of being, if we just got rid of all that plaque, then you would need to put anything

77
00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.319
in there.

78
00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.639
And so we were being very aggressive at the size of the laser compared to the coronary

79
00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.160
size and all those things.

80
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.040
And so there was a sizable complication rate and it was mostly dissections, perforations.

81
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.600
We just, large part why when we looked at the safety data from what we just talked about

82
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.600
initially was we looked at those sort of endpoints.

83
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.000
But the point is, so we're using it different now.

84
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.040
Now we're talking about lesion preparation.

85
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.560
And so, and that's really true for all Athorectomy devices now, but we're really just trying

86
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.759
to put care of that lesion.

87
00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:25.240
And so if you think about where we use laser, for example, ISR, it's a great use for that.

88
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.680
It's, again, it allows that stent to expand, that's probably under-expended in the

89
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.680
first place.

90
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.120
I will have to say that laser in and of itself was probably the easiest,

91
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.240
the easiest, the Athorectomy device to use.

92
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.240
It's incredibly easy to deliver.

93
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.199
It's incredibly easy to manipulate and move.

94
00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.600
We find that our fellows get used to it very quickly and can use it very easily.

95
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.920
And if you pick those right subsets like ISR, it's extremely safe.

96
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.759
Much safer than any sort of mechanical Athorectomy device in stent-reestimosis.

97
00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.120
A lot of folks believe that something like rotation, I'll threaten me.

98
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.079
And since it can be helpful, it creates this sort of heat and this friction that allows

99
00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:11.720
some of that stuff behind the stent to break up.

100
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.199
It can even oblate the stent in general.

101
00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.319
But that's a very complicated difficult procedure.

102
00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:21.199
It has a very high risk of that burglating in trapped, as a very high risk of having

103
00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:22.720
some other serious complications.

104
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.360
So it takes to a very experienced operator to do that.

105
00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:31.240
Or as if you look at laser, laser is just basically delivering almost a balloon over a wire,

106
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:38.040
going very slowly back and forth to a blade that sort of new and tumultissue and get behind

107
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.439
that stent and break it up.

108
00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:42.439
It's a very easy thing to do and it's very safe.

109
00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:50.160
And our study we found that it was almost as safe as if you hadn't used that for

110
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.759
to me at all in those patients.

111
00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.959
And interesting thing is if you look at something like perforation, so our perforation rate

112
00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:04.000
using laser and ISR in our NCDR study was actually less than if you had used just balloon

113
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.560
angioplasty in ISR.

114
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.439
So the idea being if you use laser to help soften and get that plaque behind it loosened up

115
00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:15.519
and then do your procedure, it's much safer than taking high pressure balloons and trying

116
00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:17.079
to inflate and crack this stent.

117
00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:19.079
It's a much higher incidence of perforation.

118
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.920
Thank you.

119
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.720
I have a historical context and I'm sure the new study is a very helpful there.
